- ### What's the problem?

Effectively manage and optimize inventory by capturing variables such as lead times, manufacturing frequency, batch size, and ordering policies from across the supply chain. Using algorithms, exception-based forecasts, and real-time downstream demand signals, suggest and
adjust inventories to optimal levels. Maintain the right amount of inventory required to meet
demand, keep logistics costs low, and avoid common inventory issues such as stockouts, overstocking, and backorders.

- ### The idea

Training a machine learning model on the historical demand data , that can forecast the inventory demands accurately ,as the overall functioning & efficiency of the entire supply chain hinges on the accuracy of the forecasted demand .T
